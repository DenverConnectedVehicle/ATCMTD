# Advanced Transportation and Congestion Management Technologies Deployment (ATCMTD) 
ATCMTD funds cutting-edge transportation technologies to reduce congestion and improve the safety of our transportation system. This is a four-year effort that kicked off in February, 2018. Denver is testing and demonstrating connected vehicle (CV) and infrastructure technology for improvements to congestion and safety for Denver residents and businesses.

Two documents are provided in this repository as part of the Systems Engineering Process, which provides an interdisciplinary approach for planning, designing, implementing (deploying), and operating a Connected Vehicle (CV) system while managing complexity, reducing risk, and promoting awareness of system/stakeholder needs and interfaces. 

## System Engineering Documentation
This series of documents will serve as the fundamental architectural design behind the program and projects, including logic and information flow diagrams, and will address security and privacy requirements associated with the program.
#### Systems Engineering Management Plan (SEMP) (Internal)
In conjunction with a project management plan, the SEMP identifies the systems engineering processes to be used in the project, the project management strategies being employed, and the risks and complexities of the program.
#### [Concept of Operations (ConOps)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nv6FZueDNuLHMIoJekEn7DWN2gQbB2HCRo682Ima5dU/edit?usp=sharing)
The concept of operations will serve as a living document that captures how the projects under ATCMTD will function from the perspective of various users. The link above provides access to the current document.
#### [System Requirements (SyRS)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14vHVvAkkvJ-TFS8i9PPnjRW3Xgz6AgjHtrzt3NY8_lw/edit?usp=sharing)
The system requirements document details all of the requirements of the system design process to ensure final product selection, software development, and system deployment meets the needs of the program. The link above provides access to the current document.
